They rake in billions yet are very cheap when it comes to taking care of their employees. For a health-centered company, the medical insurance was not super expensive, but definitely not very good. Deductible was higher than I would have liked. They really don't offer many incentives like contests or give anything away, which my previous jobs always did. Also, they were EXTREMELY strict about attendance. If you were more than a few minutes late for like three times in a row in 6 months, they would give you a warning, and yes they did fire people over tardies or being absent due to illness. They fired people left and right and it became a guessing game as to who was being boxed next. HR was the worst I've ever met and should never be allowed to deal with the public. They did not make you feel like you could talk to them at all or that they cared one iota about you. When I developed back problems from sitting so long, I asked if I could have a more ergonomic chair and they gave me the runaround and wouldn't even accept a doctor's note so that I could get a more ergonomic workstation. They tried their best to discourage me from asking for anything else. \r\n\r\nThe job itself: It was the typical corporate pit that you dreaded going to everyday. You were expected to sit at your desk and take calls like a robot, it was extremely mundane and repetitive with no incentive to improve yourself or your skills. And  they wanted you to account for time away from your desk to take a break, go to the bathroom, eat something, etc. No food or drink at your desk and they did measure how fast you took calls and how many. If you didn't meet their quota, you could get put on a performance plan and eventually fired. This place was super micromanaged at times, especially if they didn't like you or you weren't a top performer. A lot of the co-workers could be lazy too, and made a lot of mistakes that you then had to explain to the customer.

The company has steadily declined over the past two years with morale and opportunity. No one gets promoted to tier 2 anymore, so no possibility of a pay bump there. They also promise promotions or opportunities coming up and then say nothing for two years. The company used to give an annual Christmas bonus but suddenly two years ago, they stopped and didn't tell anyone until a few days before Christmas. They also cancelled any kind of merit raise, citing cash flow issues (this was right after the merger with Level 3 where humungous signing bonuses were given to execs). After backlash and hundreds of employees leaving the department, they did end up giving the 3% but not until May or June that year. This year the company announced they want a pay for performance culture but didn't even give a 3% raise to top performers in the department. We also got an email from the CEO essentially saying we needed to tighten our belts because the company was paying off debt and couldnt afford to pay us what we deserve. Employees in technical support are also dealing with very irate customers all day because the company doesn't put enough money into preventative maintenance of the network. It's then doubled up because the company also doesn't have enough techs working every day, meaning customers generally wait an average of 4-10 days before anyone comes out to repair (and that's if they show up and are on time). Insurance coverage also declined but the cost increased. I went the doctor for cold symptoms that wouldn't go away for a week and owed $80, which is $5 less than my uninsured relative pays for the same. My specialist used to cost me $65-70 out of pocket and this past year went up to $130.

They make even the most basic task, such as a wire transfer or account maintenance, feel like you're running an uphill marathon. They are zero help. For example, say you're missing something in a complex account corporate account opening, instead of pointing out what you are missing - they will leave a note that says \""call field services.\"" Out of spite, I call them directly. Speaking of automation, there is absolutely zero at Citi. All reviews are done manually. Further - there's no kind of notification system for when a review is complete.

Corporate likes to pretend they're having massive gains every year by firing people and spreading their workload among their team members, therefore artificially bumping profits. If this were done within the context of having excess staff or out of pragmatic efficiency, it wouldn't be bad. However, this is being done over and over to already-understaffed teams. This even happens multiple times to the same team, where a team of four suddenly becomes a team of two. The remaining two do not receive compensation for the additional workload not in their job descriptions, and on top of that are forced to either (or both if this happens enough times) rush out half-baked work or work weekends and afternoons to compensate for what essentially boils down to doing the job of multiple people. There he said\u002Fshe said stories about management shrugging it off as \""if they're willing to work that much for such little pay, we're not going to argue.\"" \n\nThis toxic work environment has led to many talented people leaving the company out of frustration, leaving people who are more complacent and less innovative, therefore stagnating departments, driving down the business in the long-term. So much attrition kills morale, stresses people out, and creates a cycle of attrition. I know of at least two people who were suffering from extreme stress that physically affected their well-being, one, holding a senior position, decided to finally call it quits realizing it's not worth his\u002Fher health. This ended up leading to a couple of others in the team quitting simply because FIS wanted to spread out the senior role between the team, which was already understaffed. This led to others under him\u002Fher quitting, creating a catastrophe. \n\nI only recommend FIS to people who are starting their careers and are looking for a first job. Doing so much builds a great experience base which will impress recruiters when looking for a real job. I only recommend staying long enough that will earn you the knowledge to find a functional company. You are a number to FIS that they'd cut in a nanosecond if they thought it wouldn't break anything in the short-term; it's not worth it, and in fact it quickly becomes an opportunity cost. \n\nTo give a more personal example: I suffered this similar slice-and-dice penny-pinching, ultimately ending up doing the job of a veteran senior software engineer manager who was already doing his job and the job of a lower-ranked software engineer who was fired, from a team that even then was overbooked. This came with a pathetic bump in pay only after requesting for it. I was not granted a title increase or promotion. Once I decided I had had enough, I left the firm and landed a job that gave me a senior title, almost doubled my compensation, and only has me doing my job according to my job description, not anyone else's. My experience is incredibly similar to others who also left the firm. \n\nThis is not even mentioning things like no bonuses, ancient technology, ancient DevOps, very little testing, reluctance to allocate resource to up-and-coming products, increasingly cutting events like summer outings, and my personal last straw, which was not giving anyone raises this year despite record-level inflation.

6936,9087,2011-11-05,True,1186468,2.0,3,0,0,3,2,2,"So far, my experience at Ross has been generally positive. The management at my store is friendly and helpful. Store policies were made clear from day one, and asking questions is both encouraged and well-received. Training was adequate overall. Although you'll feel out of your element for the first few days, it's easy to learn the ropes.\r\n\r\nManagement (at my store, that is) is fairly laid-back regarding time off. If you put in your time off form early, you'll probably get it, few questions asked. They don't ask for a long song and dance.\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy shopping and clothes, time will probably pass quickly. You'll find yourself admiring some of the nicer items in the store. The 20% discount will save you a lot of money in the long run.\r\n\r\nCustomers -- at least, in my experience -- have been generally friendly. Yes, there are going to be mean people: there are in any line of work, especially customer service. And yes, children are unpredictable and can cause you some headache. But, overall, it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Come in with a good attitude and you'll probably be fine.\r\n\r\nMost coworkers are nice, and making friends is easy.\r\n\r\nPart-time employees are eligible for benefits if they choose to sign up for them.\r\n\r\nHours can be reliable if your schedule is open. Most stores run with as few employees as possible, so the opportunity for a good number of hours is there. I'm part-time and I average 22.5 hours a week scheduled. Most weeks, I walk out paid for 25~26 hours (due to closing shift overtime).","Starting pay is minimum wage, and nearly everyone is hired as part-time and\u002For as seasonal work. If your state's minimum wage is 7.50, you'll be paid 7.50. If your state's minimum wage is 8.55, you'll be paid 8.55. The opportunity to increase your hourly wage comes once a year during your annual review (that I'm aware of), and most people don't make it that long. Most people start looking for a better-paying job within the first month or two. If you're hired as seasonal help, you're likely going to be kept past the holiday season, but this is because of high turnover.\r\n\r\nDon't expect much leeway starting off with regards to your schedule. You need to be clocked in on time and going to every shift for the first month or so. If you absolutely must miss a shift (see: projectile vomiting, emergency, sudden death in the family, etc.), you need to call as early as possible, and even then, calling too much too early on can get you fired. This isn't a job for people who are periodically late.\r\n\r\nTurnover is high, mostly due to the wages. Most stores lose 1~2 people a month.\r\n\r\nThe majority of employees (in pretty much every position outside of the stockroom) are women. If you don't like working with girls, you'll hate working here. I don't mind either way, but some people do.\r\n\r\nThe work can be tedious. Your feet and legs will hurt by the end of your shift. Expect to be on your feet every shift. If you're working anything but cashier or fitting room, you're going to be walking and moving almost constantly. Cashiers have a fair amount of moving around to do, however, so fitting room is the only position that has any reliable downtime. This isn't a job for the easily worn-out.\r\n\r\nIf you have a busy schedule outside of work, getting hours can be rough. If you're unavailable 3 days a week, expect to get 12~15 hours or less. Some employees get only 4 hours a week. You need to be willing to work when they need you: otherwise, don't expect a fat paycheck.\r\n\r\nClosing shift also works slightly past schedule. Our store closes at 9:00 each night, and I'm scheduled to work until 9:00 or 9:30, but I usually walk out the door at 9:50. Again: if your schedule is tight and you have outside responsibilities, this could be a bad thing.\r\n\r\nMost shifts are 4-5 hours in length. If you're part-time and want 16~25 hours a week, expect to work 4~5 days a week. This will work out to the benefit of people who don't have time in their schedule for a long shift, but it also means that you're going to be working often.","""NO_OPINION""",23,0.0,far  experience Ross generally positive  management store friendly helpful  Store policies made clear day one  asking questions encouraged wellreceived  Training adequate overall  Although feel element first days  easy learn ropesrnrnManagement  store   fairly laidback regarding time  put time form early  probably get  questions asked  nt ask long song dancernrnIf enjoy shopping clothes  time probably pass quickly  find admiring nicer items store    discount save lot money long runrnrnCustomers  least  experience  generally friendly  Yes  going mean people  line work  especially customer service  yes  children unpredictable cause headache   overall  bad people make  Come good attitude probably finernrnMost coworkers nice  making friends easyrnrnParttime employees eligible benefits choose sign themrnrnHours reliable schedule open  stores run employees possible  opportunity good number hours  parttime average  hours week scheduled  weeks  walk paid  hours  due closing shift overtime  ,Starting pay minimum wage  nearly everyone hired parttime anduFor seasonal work  state minimum wage   paid   state minimum wage   paid   opportunity increase hourly wage comes year annual review  aware   people nt make long  people start looking betterpaying job within first month two  hired seasonal help  likely going kept past holiday season  high turnoverrnrnDo nt expect much leeway starting regards schedule  need clocked time going every shift first month  absolutely must miss shift  see  projectile vomiting  emergency  sudden death family  etc    need call early possible  even  calling much early get fired  nt job people periodically laternrnTurnover high  mostly due wages  stores lose  people monthrnrnThe majority employees  pretty much every position outside stockroom  women  nt like working girls  hate working  nt mind either way  people dornrnThe work tedious  feet legs hurt end shift  Expect feet every shift  working anything cashier fitting room  going walking moving almost constantly  Cashiers fair amount moving around  however  fitting room position reliable downtime  nt job easily wornoutrnrnIf busy schedule outside work  getting hours rough  unavailable  days week  expect get  hours less  employees get  hours week  need willing work need  otherwise  nt expect fat paycheckrnrnClosing shift also works slightly past schedule  store closes  night  scheduled work    usually walk door    schedule tight outside responsibilities  could bad thingrnrnMost shifts  hours length  parttime want  hours week  expect work  days week  work benefit people nt time schedule long shift  also means going working often ,1,1
